					<h2>James Auger</h2>
					<p>James Auger is a designer, researcher and lecturer operating at the intersection of art and industrial design. He is a tutor at the RCA: Design Interactions and visiting professor at the Haute école d'art et de design (HEAD) in Geneva. Together with Jimmy Loizeau, James runs Auger-Loizeau - design studio based in London, and they have been collaborating on projects since the concept of the Audio Tooth Implant which was first conceived in October 2000.</p>

					<p>[Industrial] Design is mostly concerned with the process of bringing products to market, making them desirable and therefore saleable. With a slight sideways step, Auger-Loizeau believes that by removing the commercial aspect from the requirements of the object, ID it can adopt a whole different agenda, questioning the process that gives birth to it rather than blindly conforming to it. In this way design can comment on consumer culture, the role of products and the ubiquity and function of technology. It becomes a tool for questioning rather than problem solving. Through the development and dissemination of speculative and critical products and services they hope to instigate a broader analysis of what it means to exist in a technology rich environment both today and in the near future.</p>

					<p>Their goal is for this analysis to take place over a broad a spectrum. Thus their work may be seen anywhere from Wired magazine to The Sun newspaper, or as a demo in a public square in Linz to an exhibition in Beijing. Many of their projects are self-generated and self-funded but they also participate in industry funded research projects, commissions, workshops and the very occasional commercial project.</p>

				<h2 style="clear:both;">Computer Vision (booked out)</h2>
				<img src="img/cv.jpg" />
				<p>“Computer Vision” refers to a broad collection of techniques that allow computers to make intelligent assertions about what's going on in digital images and video. Thanks to recent advances in affordable vision technologies (such as Kinect, IR webcams, and Leap Motion), and armed with a slew of powerful but simple heuristics (tricks!) for extracting useful information from images -- a large number of artists have begun to explore the new possibilities for interaction made possible by cameras.</p>

				<p>This hands-on workshop is oriented toward understanding and learning how to use visual pixel processing -- especially of bodies, faces and hands. It offers a practical introduction to computer vision techniques for creating interesting interactions in Processing (for novices) and OpenFrameworks (for intermediate students). Participants will learn about: direct pixel access and image manipulation; detecting and measuring motion; detecting the presence and location of people; and tracking objects and faces. These techniques are supported by intuitive, visually-oriented examples and code fragments written for popular arts-engineering toolkits — and a presentation that cuts through technical jargon to focus on what’s really useful for artists and designers.</p>

				<p>The workshop is lead by <a href="#mcdonald">Kyle McDonald</a>.</p>

				<table>
					<tr>
						<td width="80px" valign="top"><strong>you need</strong></td>

				<h2>Digital Analog Surface (BOOKED OUT)</h2> 
				<img src="img/DigitalAnalogSurface.jpg" />
				<p>The aim of that workshop is to integrate both process and workflow of desktop-manufacturing into an interactive design process. We discuss the qualities of analogue and digital techniques by marrying the precision of computer-control with the imprecision of hands-on making, mess and mistakes. The workshop will explore digital and analogue methods of generating images and manipulating materials for art and design. Participants will learn to create code using ‘Processing’ (open source generative design software) to drive machinery such as computer numerical control (CNC) routers and/or laser machines. Image editing on our portable cnc milling machine with our 
				own tools, according to the motto: "to drill, to plane, to cut, to scratch - where images are edited, splinters must fall". The fundamental principles of patterns will be explored and declined with the aim to translate graphical characteristics into material behavior. Basic principles of graphic design, like transformation, progression and permutation are serving as a starting point. </p>

				<p>The Workshop is held by Prof. Steffi Hußlein, Robert Laux, Konrad, Malte and Benjamin<br/>

				<h2>E27plusMore - The Digitally Enhanced Universal Light Bulb (booked out)</h2> 
				<img src="img/E27plusMore.jpg" />
				<p>E27plusMore is a reverence to the classical Edison screw invented 1909 and used since then as the standard for light bulbs. Let’s take this ubiquitous E-27 screw and make an update to it:<br/>
				In this 4-hour workshop the participants will first augment a classical light-bulb thread with an Arduino microcontroller, and then use this device as a breeding ground for their own miniature autoactive/reactive/interactive installation built onto it. </p>
				 
				<p>The workshop fee of 1909 Euro cents includes all the ingredients for building your own takeaway E27plusMore device:<br/>
				+ E-27 threaded screw<br/>
				+ Power adapter<br/>
				+ Arduino Nano<br/>
				+ Servo motor<br/>
				+ Various plastic parts<br/>
				</p>
				<p>We are looking forward to many bright applications to come…<br/>
				The workshop will be held by Felix Hardmood Beck and Simon Schiessl.</p>

				<p><strong>Felix Hardmood Beck</strong> loves to find non-intentional use for technical equipment and wants to find the limits of technology to then cross those borders and design specific needs from it. He works as Art Director and Concept Designer for the design studio ART+COM. <a href="http://felix-beck.de">felix-beck.de</a><br/>
				<strong>Simon Schiessl</strong> is an engineer and artist. With a strong background in physics, engineering, media sciences and art practice he has been active in the techno-art scene for several years, two of which he spend as a researcher at the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge/USA. <a href="http://www.signalfluss.de">signalfluss.de</a></p>

				<h2>Fifty Shades of Shaders</h2> 
				<img src="img/shaders.jpg" />

				<p>An introduction to shaders for creative coders and code enthusiasts. Learn how to harness the power of your GPU to create high quality 2D and 3D visuals realtime.</p>

				<p>Shaders are a powerful instrument in a creative coder’s toolbox. Regardless, they often pass as some kind of impenetrable black magic. As you will learn over the course of the day, this reputation is mostly undeserved. The basics are really quite simple to grasp, provided you know where to start. VVVV, Touch Designer, Cinder and OpenFrameworks (just to mention a few) all support shaders to some extent so this is as portable of a knowledge as you can get. Since its 2.0 release, Processing also offers an easy implementation of GLSL shaders through the PShader class, courtesy of Andres Colubri.</p>

				<p>The workshop is open to all coders with little to no previous knowledge of shaders. It will start with a quick introduction to the theory behind shaders and will then focus on hands-on tinkering and experiments in code. Participants will learn the basics of working with GLSL shaders to generate 2D and 3D visuals in real-time and the ability to integrate shaders easily in their own projects. We will use Processing.</p>

				<p>The workshop is lead by Raphaël de Courville and Moco (<a href="http://www.elektropastete.de/" target="_blank">Elektropastete</a>)</p>

				<h2>vvvv - real world computing</h2> 
				<img src="img/vvvv.jpg" />
				<p>Computer science is a very young and evolving topic in human history. Textual programming as it's commonly used today emerged from early machine languages and is clearly not the end of the story. In this workshop you will learn what comfort, development speed and freedom you will gain from using the visual realtime programming environment <a href="http://vvvv.org" target="_blank">vvvv</a>.</p>
				<p>After a little theory we will dig into examples which demonstrate some of vvvv's magic powers. The topics may include (in random order):<br/>
				- visual programming<br/>
				- setting up a vvvv project<br/>
				- video input and analysis<br/>
				- kinect, leap<br/>
				- 3d scenes<br/>
				- shaders<br/>
				- textual programming in vvvv<br/>
				- connecting hardware and sensors</p>

				<p>The workshop is held by Tebjan Halm and joreg, who are both core developers of vvvv.</p>

					<h2>ticket info</h2>
					<p>An essential part of retune is the diverse audience. We like to see attendees from a variety of backgrounds and professional levels, so we aim to keep the ticket prices low in order that they not be an object to attending. This year we introduce a new ticket structure with three levels: student ticket, regular ticket and professional. Please see on the right for more information.</p>

					<p><strong>All tickets are for the full conference—there will be no day-passes this year.</strong></p>
				
					<h2>workshops</h2>
					<p>This year the workshops will run on the first day (Friday, September 27), starting in the morning and running until the conference kicks off at 6pm. This means a concentrated time for learning and trying out new stuff, and you won't miss any of the talks.</p>
					<p><strong>The workshops are not included in the conference tickets. They will be paid on site directly to the workshop leaders.</strong></p>

					<h2>Invoices</h2>
					<strong><p>If you haven't purchased a ticket yet and want to have an invoice, use <a href="https://tito.io/retune/retune13" target="_blank">this ticketshop</a>.</strong> 
					<p>Of course you can also get a proper legal invoice for the tickets you have already purchased. Unfortunately our payment provider Paylogic does not have an automated solution for generating them at the moment. To keep things simple they will generate them in one go after the conference (or as soon as we have sold all the tickets).</p>
